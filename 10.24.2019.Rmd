# Get Started

```{r}
x = rnorm(30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again = rnorm(25, mean = 4, sd = 2.5)
y = rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 2)

# z scores for this vector
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  z
  
}

z_scores(x)
```

# Creating the function

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  z
  
}

z_scores(x)
```

```{r}
z_scores(x = x)

z_scores(x = y)
```


```{r}
# doesnt work always for charcter vectors or factors
z_scores(x = 3)
# z_scores(x = "my name is hannah")
z_scores(x = c(TRUE, TRUE , FALSE, TRUE))
```

# Conditional execution

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Argument x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x) == 1) {
    stop("Z scores cannot be computed for length 1 vectors")
  }
  
  z = mean(x) / sd(x)
  
  z
}
