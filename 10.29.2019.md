## Function from last time

  )
}
```

## Creating a list for output

``` r
output = vector("list", length = 4)
```

# For loop

``` r
output = vector("list", length = 4)

## For the function i in our vector 1 through 4, iterate over if it's the object 1,2,3 or 4
for (i in 1:4) {
  output[[i]] = mean_and_sd(df[[i]])
}

# Shows the mean and st dev of each of the outputs we made above
output 
```

    ## [[1]]
    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##    mean    sd
    ##   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1  2.70  1.12
    ## 
    ## [[2]]
    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##    mean    sd
    ##   <dbl> <dbl>

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##    mean    sd
    ##   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 -3.43  1.18

## Changing for loop into map statement

``` r
## this is my input, for each input i want mean and sd, and that's what i want as my output (map over my intput and get the output I'm interested in)
output = map(df, mean_and_sd)

output = map_df(.x = df, ~ mean_and_sd(.x))

output = vector("list", length = 4)

for (i in 1:4) {
  output[[i]] = median(df[[i]])
}

output = map(df, median)
```

``` r
output_summary = map(df, summary)

output_median = map_dbl(df, median)
output = map_dfr(df, mean_and_sd)
```

## Revisiting Napoleon

``` r
read_page_reviews = function(url) {
  
  h = read_html(url)
  
  title = h %>%
    html_nodes("#cm_cr-review_list .review-title") %>%
    html_text()
  
  stars = h %>%
    html_nodes("#cm_cr-review_list .review-rating") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_extract("\\d") %>%
    as.numeric()
  
  text = h %>%
    html_nodes(".review-data:nth-child(5)") %>%
    html_text()
  
  data_frame(title, stars, text)
}

## Creating vector of Url's

url_base = "https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00005JNBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_rvwer?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&sortBy=recent&pageNumber="
vec_urls = str_c(url_base, 1:5)

## COuld do this 5 times to show each page but we want to make a list
read_page_reviews(vec_urls[[1]])
```
